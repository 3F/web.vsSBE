# Continuous Integration (CI)

Starting with [v0.11](/Changelist/), the vsSolutionBuildEvent can be used for [continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) with other tools...

[![Example with AppVeyor](../Resources/ci_example_appveyor.png)](../CI/CI.MSBuild/)

It's possible with next additional utilities:

* [CI.MSBuild](../CI/CI.MSBuild/) - for work through msbuild.exe (MSBuild Tools)
* [Devenv Command-Line](../CI/Devenv Command-Line/) - for work through devenv of the Visual Studio
