# SBE-Scripts

{% assign infoData = "Uses [SobaScript](https://github.com/3F/SobaScript) Starting from **1.14.** Part of the documentation may be irrelevant. Please update me." %}
{% include elem/info %}

Togehter with [MSBuild](../MSBuild/) provides and powerful conditions, subcommands, file operations, and lot of other.

## Components

{% include doc/SBE-Scripts/Components.html %}

## Syntax

All commands and operations should be wrapped with container:

```{{site.sbelang1}}
#[ ... ]
```

To escape an sequences use `#`: 

```{{site.sbelang1}}
##[ ... ]
```

### Sample

Try execute this:

```{{site.sbelang}}
#["
    Basic example
"]
#[var v = 1.2.3]
#[var log = $(TMP)/v.txt]

#[($(Configuration) ~= Deb || true)
{
    #[var tBase     = $([System.DateTime]::Parse('2015/10/01').ToBinary())]
    #[var tNow      = $([System.DateTime]::UtcNow.Ticks)]
    #[var revBuild  = #[$(
                        [System.TimeSpan]::FromTicks('$(
                            [MSBuild]::Subtract(
                            $(tNow), 
                            $(tBase))
                        )')
                        .TotalMinutes
                        .ToString('0'))]]
    
    #[var v = $(v).$([MSBuild]::Modulo($(revBuild), $([System.Math]::Pow(2, 14))))]
}]

#[var v = $([System.String]::Format("v{0}\r\n\t", $(v)))]
#[File write("#[var log]"):> Example #[var v] Generated by vsSolutionBuildEvent]
#[IO scall("notepad", "#[var log]")]

$(n = $([System.Math]::Exp('$([MSBuild]::Multiply($([System.Math]::Log(2)), 16))')))
$(n)
```

## Arguments

{% include elem/fillme %}

type       | description
-----------|------------
integer    | Signed 32-bit integer
string     | From double quotes & From single quotes
char       |
float      | Signed floating-point number with single-precision. The `f` postfix for clarify: 1.25f, -1.25f
double     | Signed floating-point number with double-precision. The optional `d` postfix for clarify: 1.25d or simply 1.25, -1.25
enum       |
const      |
expression | The composite definition, like a conditional expression ~ `(((1 < 2) && true) || $(debug) != "r200")` etc.

### Object type

The object type is new type for work with complex mixed data. Initially it was implemented special for [vsCommandEvent]({{site.lnkVSGallery_vsCE}}).

*The vsSBE users should see this starting with v0.12.5+*

Value can be from all available scalar types + complex, like this:

```{{site.sbelang1}}
{}
{"str", true}
{"str", {1, 'y', {-12.457f}}, true}
```
etc.

### Boolean type

Allowed forms:

true  | false
------|-------
1     | 0
True  | False
TRUE  | FALSE
true  | false

### In (Input) type

This is the unspecified or mixed data. Used as defined and the engine will consider it 'as is':

* May contain any count of newline symbols.
* As and for string arguments may contain other inner sbe-scripts containers that will be evaluated before.

It's also safe for pair symbols of container (`[`, `]`). For unpaired it will be corrupt. Therefore, you should place your data inside quote symbols as a string argument above or use special marker (*v0.12.6+*):

```text
<#data> ... </#data>
```

## Dom & Code Completion

With latest versions we use [Dom](../../Dev/New Component/) for inspecting model of SBE-Scripts core. You can see all available features with code completion (Intellisense) in editor.

## Work from other Modes

The all [available modes](../../Modes/) should provide support of this engine. Moreover, in [C# Mode](../../Modes/CSharp/#work-with-msbuild-amp-sbe-scripts-engine) you can also use engine **directly** as you want! 
But first read [this](../SBE-Scripts/Direct/).
