### New Features & bug fixes

For existing or new things. Have ideas ? Or is ready for bug fixing or improving performance ? Good!

Start with [Developer Zone]({{site.docp}}/Dev/)

### Wiki

You can also add new or improve any existing pages for current wiki.

Share some solutions/examples with community of your experiences. Use [Edit] buttons or Start new [here]({{site.docp}}/New/)

*Take a few minutes of your time for helping for other our users. From short useful script/note or any complete solution.*

### GUI

Improvement or complete replacement of current UI (main GUI, console, tool pane, ..)

* Namespace: net.r_eg.vsSBE.**UI**

Start with [Developer Zone]({{site.docp}}/Dev/)

**Please note:** planned to separate this namespace into the new project (this is really needed with [API]({{site.docp}}/API) and all [related subprojects]({{site.docp}}/Scheme/)). Write before [here](https://bitbucket.org/3F/vssolutionbuildevent/issues/new)
